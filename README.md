> Hello, world! It's David Mounder! 
> 
> I'm excited to share with you My Collection of Sound Schemes from my recent rubric on my YouTube channel titled 'I transformed the Classic Startups into Windows 11!'
> 
> This folder comprises nearly all of my transformed sound schemes, with the exception of Win 98. The original sound scheme for Win 98 featured a wide variety of sounds, 
> making it unrealistic for me to recreate. I apologize for this omission... I couldn't even transform the Win98 startup sound. What are we talking about, right?
> 
> #### A few questions about my sound schemes:
> 
> **Q: What is the purpose of creating these sound schemes?**
> A: I decided to try this direction, as splitting sounds can be annoying at times, I already recently lost half of my splits due to the death of my ssd.. 
> And it's even thrown me off a bit. I was also wondering what WinXP would sound like, Win11 style (actually, I don't really like the melodies in Win11... 
> it does kind of but I'm used to the older sound format), and I was happy with the result and decided to do the same for the rest of Windows.
> 
> **Q: Can I use your sound schemes in my videos?**
> A: While it may not be particularly useful as a sound effect for general content, you are welcome to try using it. I believe it could work well for showcasing Windows 
> or in TikTok content. However, it's challenging for me to guarantee suitability for other types of content. If you decide to incorporate it into your concepts, please 
> credit my channel so that viewers can identify the source of the sound.
> 
> **Q: Can I use your sound schemes in my Windows builds?**
> A: It would be great if someone incorporates my sound schemes into their Windows builds. Feel free to send me your builds for evaluation.. you can use my email below. 
> Just remember to prefix the name so that I can easily identify your letter!
> 
> Enjoy!
